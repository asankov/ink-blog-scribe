# Building Scalable React Applications: Architecture Patterns That Work

Building a React application that can scale from a small prototype to a production system serving thousands of users requires thoughtful architecture from day one. I've seen too many projects start simple and beautiful, only to become unmaintainable messes as they grow.

## The Problem with "Just Start Coding"

When we start a new React project, it's tempting to jump straight into components and start building features. This works great for the first few weeks, but as the application grows, we start encountering problems:

- Components become massive and difficult to test
- State management becomes chaotic
- Business logic gets scattered throughout the UI
- Code reuse becomes nearly impossible

## Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Keep your business logic separate from your UI logic. Your components should focus on rendering and user interactions, not on complex data transformations or API calls.

```typescript
// Bad: Business logic mixed with UI
const UserProfile = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("/api/user")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => {
        // Complex data transformation logic here
        const transformedUser = {
          ...data,
          fullName: `${data.firstName} ${data.lastName}`,
          isVip: data.purchases > 1000,
        };
        setUser(transformedUser);
      });
  }, []);

  return <div>{user?.fullName}</div>;
};

// Good: Separated concerns
const UserProfile = () => {
  const { user, isLoading } = useUser();

  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;

  return <div>{user?.fullName}</div>;
};
```

### 2. Custom Hooks for Logic Reuse

Custom hooks are React's way of sharing stateful logic between components. They're perfect for encapsulating data fetching, form handling, and other common patterns.

### 3. Component Composition Over Props Drilling

Instead of passing props through multiple levels, use composition patterns and context where appropriate.

## Folder Structure That Scales

Here's a folder structure I've found works well for teams:

```
src/
├── components/          # Reusable UI components
│   ├── ui/             # Basic UI elements (Button, Input, etc.)
│   └── common/         # Common business components
├── features/           # Feature-based organization
│   ├── auth/
│   ├── dashboard/
│   └── settings/
├── hooks/              # Custom hooks
├── services/           # API calls and external services
├── utils/              # Pure utility functions
└── types/              # TypeScript type definitions
```

## State Management Strategy

Not every application needs Redux. Here's my decision tree:

1. **Local state** - For component-specific data
2. **Context** - For sharing data across a component tree
3. **URL state** - For data that should be shareable/bookmarkable
4. **Server state** - For data from APIs (use React Query or SWR)
5. **Global state** - Only when the above aren't sufficient

## Testing Strategy

A scalable application needs a solid testing strategy:

- **Unit tests** for pure functions and custom hooks
- **Integration tests** for feature workflows
- **End-to-end tests** for critical user journeys

## Key Takeaways

1. **Plan your architecture early** - It's easier to start with good patterns than to refactor later
2. **Keep components small and focused** - They should have a single responsibility
3. **Invest in developer experience** - Good tooling and patterns make the team more productive
4. **Test the right things** - Focus on behavior, not implementation details

Building scalable React applications is as much about discipline as it is about technical knowledge. Start with good patterns, and your future self will thank you.
